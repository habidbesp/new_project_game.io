## Functionality

In a simple but a really fun way, [PHASER 3](https://phaser.io/) explains how to develop your game using different features like animations and physics from different libraries like [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) and [arcade.js](https://github.com/mar10/arcade-js#:~:text=ArcadeJS%20is%20a%202d%20game,of%20the%20Rip%2DOff%20game.).

The target in this game is to collect as many coins as possible using the coursors "right" and "left" to move in the "X" axis, and the coursor "up" to jump over the platforms ("Y" axis).

every time the player collects a coin, the score will increase 10 points.
